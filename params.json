{"name":"Ardutracker","tagline":"Version [0.9.0]","body":"# ArduTracker\r\n\r\nThe ArduTracker is a light weight, easy to build FPV Tracker. It uses the downlink of the audio channel from the Transmitter as telemetry link. But this project is different from most others. ArduTracker is a continuous 360° degree Tracker with a special hinge. This [Video](https://vimeo.com/3991479) shows it best.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to [Cesco1](https://github.com/Cesco1) who made this possible. \r\n***\r\n\r\n##[Wiki](https://github.com/QuadMax/ArduTracker/wiki) --||-- [RoadMap](https://github.com/QuadMax/ArduTracker/wiki/RoadMap)\r\n***\r\n\r\n###Milestone [0.9.0]\r\nToday the compass could be implemented. This take us a step closer to a stable Version that has got all features.\r\nThe system´s components could be tested succesfully each by their own.\r\nA whole system test comes soon.\r\n* **This is new:**\r\n * implemented compass\r\n\r\n###Milestone [0.8.1]\r\nWe are close leaving BETA! Heureka.\r\n* **This is new:**\r\n* The pcb design have been reworked. Now we got a groundstation that could power up 5 more devices. With 35um copper thickness it could bear 3 Ampere or 4.5 Ampere with 70um copper thickness.\r\n* Furthermore the code got a rework too.\r\n  * implemented cesco1´s PSK modem instead FSK\r\n  * implemented 270 degree servos\r\n  * implemented display / Menu / buttons\r\n  * implemented servo invert with jumper on the uno shield\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Milestone [0.1.1]\r\n* New pcb design with power distribution. \r\n  Now you could power up 3 more devices of your ground station with the pcb. Up to 2.5 Ampere. with 35um copper thickness.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Milestone [0.1.0]\r\n* pcb design first try\r\n\r\n### Milestone [0.0.1]\r\n* released Alpha\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
